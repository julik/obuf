# obuf

A simple Ruby object buffer. Use this if you need to temporarily store alot of serializable Ruby objects.

    obuf = Obuf.new
    5_000_000.times{  obuf.push(compute_some_object) } # no memory inflation
    obuf.each do | stored_object | # objects are restored one by one
      # do something with stored_object
    end

You can also write objects in one process, and recover them in another, using `Obuf::Lens`:

    # In fork process
    File.open('/tmp/output.bin', 'a') do |f|
      Obuf::Lens.new(f) << my_object
    end
    
    # In join process after forks completed
    File.open('/tmp/output.bin', 'r') do |f|
      Obuf::Lens.new(f).each do | object_written_by_fork |
        puts object_written_by_fork.inspect
      end
    end

The `Lens` is what is used under the hood in the main Obuf as well.
